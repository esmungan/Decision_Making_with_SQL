# Decision_Making_with_SQL

The following project addresses four business decisions for a fictional Chinook Records management based on their available data. These decisions to be made are:

* Which newcomer artist/s should be advertised for US market?
* Whether there are sales representatives performing better or worse than others
* Which countries have potential to grow?
* Whether the company should stop buying albums as a whole and start buying only popular tracks from record labels to reduce costs

The dataset to be consulted is provided at: https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database
